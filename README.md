# Getting Started 
I began this project first by creating a folder that would hold all my files. Next I created the blank files I thought would be neccissary for my project. After having my files in order, I decided to work in mysql first.

# installation process

Before I begin on the data, I would like to mention a few neccissary npm package installs for this project.

* npm install mysql - to be able to reference mysql files for data.
* npm install inquirer - used to prompt user in terminal.

# Running the tests

All the tests I ran were in vscode terminal as can be seen running in the video included in the link below. The video contains only a showing of the functionality of my program and not how it is built.
